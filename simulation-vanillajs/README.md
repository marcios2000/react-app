# Project Summary

This project is designed to give you an opportunity to build something from scratch and to connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one project.

Your mentors will be providing minimal help, as this is a chance to push yourself. They can point you in the right direction, but won't help you write the syntax to make it happen. This project is a chance for you to combine the skills you've learned so far.

Good luck and work hard!

# Setup

Fork and clone this repository (this will get you easy access to the icon images). Make sure to commit and push your code often. It's not fun to lose any of your work.

You will need to create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and connect them yourself to get started.

# Design

Here is what your application should look like. Try to copy the styling as closely as you can.

This guide provides the information you will need to match the design. The icons can be found in the `assets` folder of this repo.

# Functionality

Websites also need to do things, so you'll need to add some JavaScript.

* You should display a list of all the monthly expenses.
  * The list of expenses should be stored in a variable so you can manipulate it more easily.
* You should be able to add a new bill to your list of expenses using the form.
* You should be able to remove a bill from your list of expenses using the trash can button next to it.
* You should calculate the total of all your expenses and display it in the header.
  * This should update anytime a new bill is added.
  * This should updates anytime a bill is deleted.
